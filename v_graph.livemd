Week Goals

* Day 1 and Day 2 of Week 4
* [Stretch Goal] All of Week 4
* [Maintenance] Week 1 Content Updates
* [Maintenance] Automated Testing System
* [Maintenance] Add Licence

General Feedback

* Seems like a lot of content, what can we remove?
* Remove the custom deployment of self-made server, add deployment later in the course. 
  What deployment should we use? (Recommendations made to partner with Fly)
* Potential order changes: Some Week 9 topics could be sooenr
* adding stretch goals or extra credit sections
* add a survey of students

## Questions

What can we effectively remove?

## Takeaway

Will add restrictions to README when licence found.
