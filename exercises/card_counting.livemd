## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Card Counting

Card counting is a blackjack strategy used to determine whether the player or the dealer has an advantage on the next hand.

The most common strategy is the **Hi-Lo** strategy where we keep a running total based on the cards
dealt. We either add 1, subtract 1, or do nothing based on the card's value.

Card values are as follows:

* 2-6 = `+1`
* 7-9 = `0`
* 10-14= `-1` (for 10 -> Ace)

### Card (4)

When the current card is `4` and the current count is `0` what is the `next_count`? 
Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
card = 4
count = 0

next_count = nil

Utils.feedback(:card_count_four, next_count)
```

### Card King (13)

When the current card is a King `(13)` and the current count is `5` what is the `next_count`?
Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
card = 13
count = 5

next_count = nil

Utils.feedback(:card_count_king, next_count)
```

Now the current card is a random card between `2` and `14`. We've used the `Utils` project to generate a random number.

Use comparison operators to determine `next_count`.

Remember that you can check if a comparison is true, and then return a value using `&&`.

i.e.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
card = 4
count = 0
next_count = card <= 6 && count + 1 # returns 1
```

Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir
# a random integer between 2 and 14
random_card = Utils.random(2..14)

count = 0

next_count = nil

Utils.feedback(:card_count_random, [random_card, next_count])
```
