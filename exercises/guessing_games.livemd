## Guess the Word

In the Elixir cell below create a word guessing game.

* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess as a string.
* Bind a variable `answer` to the actual answer as a string.
* Check that the `guess` matches the answer. bind `correct` to `"Correct!"` 
  if the answer and guess match or `"Incorrect."` if they don't.

Run the code with a correct and incorrect `guess` to ensure
your code passes the tests.

```elixir
guess = nil
answer = nil

correct = nil

Utils.test(:guess_the_word, [guess, answer, correct])
```

## Guess the Number

In the Elixir cell below create a number guessing game.

* Bind a variable `guess` to the player's guess as an integer.
* Bind a variable `answer` to the actual answer as an integer.
* If `guess` equals `answer` bind `correct` to `"Correct!"`
* If `guess` is less than `answer` bind `correct` to `"Too low!"`
* If `guess` is greater than `answer` bind `correct` to `"Too low!"`

Run your code with an equal, smaller, and larger `guess` than the `answer` to ensure your
code passes all tests.

```elixir
guess = nil
answer = nil

correct = nil

Utils.test(:guess_the_number, [guess, answer, correct])
```
